# The following is the order of the links in the header of the website.

# Changing the order here will adjust the order and you can also add additional
# links. Removing a link prevents it from showing in the header, but does not
# prevent it from being included in the site.

# NOTE that only one of the CV options should be selected, the first is for the
#      Markdown formatted page while the second is generated using JSON.
